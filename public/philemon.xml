<bktlong>The Epistle of Paul to PHILEMON.</bktlong>
<bktshort>Philemon</bktshort>
<chapter><chtitle>Chapter 1</chtitle>
<v>Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
</v>
<v>And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
</v>
<v>Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
</v>
<v>I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
</v>
<v>Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
</v>
<v>That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
</v>
<v>For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
</v>
<v>Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
</v>
<v>Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
</v>
<v>I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
</v>
<v>Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
</v>
<v>Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
</v>
<v>Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
</v>
<v>But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
</v>
<v>For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
</v>
<v>Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
</v>
<v>If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
</v>
<v>If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
</v>
<v>I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
</v>
<v>Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
</v>
<v>Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
</v>
<v>But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
</v>
<v>There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
</v>
<v>Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
</v>
<v>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
</v>
